# factoriomod_dequalitier
Mod for Factorio game. Dequalitier is a chest that downgrades high quality items to its own quality. How to use: craft dequalitier of, say, rare quality. If you put a legendary item into it, it will convert it to rare item. Putting an item with lower than rare quality won't affect it at all. Also works with modded quality levels.
